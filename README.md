## LROData

Data cleaning, visualization, and basic analysis for Logan River Observatory Hydrologic and Climatological data. Major project operations are carried out in the **"LRO_Data.RMD"** script, which calls data from the LRO HydroServer API, makes some basic plots, and performs basic analysis.

### Project structure: 

- Raw data manually downloaded from the LRO Hydroserver Page (https://lro.hydroserver.org/browse) are stored in the **"data"** folder. 
- Processing and analysis scripts are stored in the **"scripts"** folder.
- All outputs (plots, cleaned data files, etc.) are stored in the **"outputs"** folder.
